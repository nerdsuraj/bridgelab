step1- created a directory stage1-review.

step2- created files (day4.sh,x.java,y.py,z.js, algorithm.txt) inside stage1-review directory.

step3- uses nano day4.sh to do editing/modification for given condition

step4- inside day4.sh scripting file uses for loop for given condition
        (nano day4.sh)

step5- using for loop to read each file and to display files with x.java,y.py,z.js
        (for files in `ls *.java` ls *.py` ls *.js

step 6- Create a new folder with same name as a file-name
               Expected Result : x/  y/  z/ 

step7- create sub-folder as per your file-extension-names 
			Expected Result : java/py/js

step8 - cut a original file & paste into a specific subfolder 
			Expected Result :      java/x.java
						py/y.py
						js/z.js 




for files in `ls *.java` `ls *.py` `ls *.js`

do
      folderName=`echo $files | awk -F. '{print $1}'`
      folderName2=`echo $files | awk -F. '{print $2}'`
      mkdir -p $folderName/$folderName2
      mv $files $folderName/$folderName2
done
