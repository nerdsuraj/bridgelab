step:-1
first we have to take three numbers from user

step:-2
then put into in array index

step3:-
after that i just show them thats its your original number with the help of arr

step4:-
i iterate the value of for ((i = 0; i<4; i++)) then comes into the another loop part,

step5:-
here i just iterate the j value for ((j = 0; j<4-i-1; j++) and check that j value come under the circumstance or not

step6:-
then i put if part inside the 2nd for loop if [ ${arr[j]} -gt ${arr[$((j+1))]} ] and check that arr j is greter then from arr j+1

ste7:-
 temp=${arr[j]}, store the arr j value in temp variable

ste8:-
 arr[$j]=${arr[$((j+1))]}, store the arr j +1 value in only in arr j

step9:-
now its comes the 2nd part of the question is accending the order

step10:-
for ((i = 0; i<4; i++)) , check the i value is less then from 4 then is comes to the under part of the loop

step11 :- 
for((j=0; j<4-i-1; j++)) , inside the for loop i also check that whether j value is less then 4-i-1

step12:-

then after 2nd loopi just put if condition to check the whether arr j value is less than from arr j+1

if [ ${arr[j]} -lt ${arr[$((j+1))]} ]


step13:-
step 13 is just like the step 7 and step 8 just check at above.

step14:-
then after step 13 we tring to solve the decending part of the array with ${arr[@]}
.

result:-thats how we make the arry ascendig and decending order.
